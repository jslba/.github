# JavaScript Libraries by Angelisium


## FAQ's

**Why a dedicated organization?**   
Simply because there are too many repositories and I don't want to pollute the visibility of my github profile with repositories that are less important to me.

**Are they actively maintained?**   
No. Most of them are libraries that I needed for very specific projects, like reverse engineering or task automation projects.

**Is it open for contribution?**   
Yes, of course.
